# M8 Company Registry (multi-company) — detection + routing + framing port (no-node)
# Load-bearing checks: ROUTING (does a non-Bolt company / cross-company query inject
# the right context?) and HONESTY FRAMING (unprofiled companies are never invented;
# the roster says don't-conflate). Bolt is NOT solo-injected (the fleet/finance spine
# owns it) and appears only in the cross-company roster.
# ASCII only (PowerShell 5.1 mangles multibyte in a no-BOM .ps1).
#   Run:  powershell -File tests/companies-verify.ps1
