/**
 * M8 Eval — Probe Battery (tests/eval/probes.js)
 *
 * A repeatable, scored battery M8 runs against itself so "where does M8 stand"
 * becomes a NUMBER tracked over time (results/history.jsonl). Categories map to
 * the maturity scorecard, plus the three adversarial-QA probes the retired team
 * panel banked: COMPRESSION (GPT), SILENT-FAIL (Manus), PROMPT-BYPASS (Gemini).
 *
 * Each probe:
 *   { id, category, title, weight, turns: [{ send, checks[], }], note }
 * A turn's `checks` are graded by graders.js. Multi-turn probes share a capture
 * bag across turns (for the Compression consistency test) and carry the running
 * conversation as `history` to /api/chat.
 *
 * GROUNDING RULE for exact-value checks: only assert figures for COMPLETED past
 * days (immutable) — never "today/yesterday" (the blob moves daily). Most fleet
 * checks are BEHAVIOURAL (grounds-in-a-number / refuses-to-fabricate / stays
 * consistent) so the battery stays valid as the data grows.
