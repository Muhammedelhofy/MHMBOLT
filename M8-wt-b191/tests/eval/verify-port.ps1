# M8 Eval - PowerShell .NET-regex verification port
# Mirrors graders.js + scorecard.js logic so the harness can be verified WITHOUT
# local node (the project's standard no-node verification path). Run:
#   powershell -File tests/eval/verify-port.ps1
# NOTE: pure-ASCII on purpose. PowerShell 5.1 reads a no-BOM UTF-8 .ps1 as ANSI
# and mangles multibyte chars (box-drawing, Arabic thousands sep U+066C), which
# breaks string quoting. The JS sources keep the Arabic separator; ASCII test
# inputs here exercise the same logic.
