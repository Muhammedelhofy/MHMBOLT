/**
 * M8 Company Registry — lib/companies.js
 *
 * Operator-assistant breadth (multi-company): M8 used to assume EVERY business
 * question was about the Bolt driver fleet (the system prompt persona + the fleet
 * spine are Bolt-shaped). As Muhammad runs more than one company (Bolt 3PL today;
 * Thrivve.sa / Noon / others), M8 must reason about each SEPARATELY and never
 * carry Bolt's fleet numbers onto a different company.
 *
 * This is the context layer: a registry of his companies (sector, role, model,
 * key facts, and an optional data source linking to the deterministic spine).
 * When a non-Bolt company is named, or a cross-company question is asked, the
 * relevant context/roster is injected — additive, like a playbook (it does NOT
 * suppress search/router), so the normal pipeline still answers.
 *
 * HONESTY (load-bearing): only Bolt is PROFILED here, from verified facts. Other
 * companies are registered BY NAME but UNPROFILED — M8 must say it doesn't have
 * their details and ASK, never invent a sector/role/data for them. The registry
 * is a seed; richer per-company facts accrue through the normal memory spine, and
 * a company's dataSource.row can later point the fleet/finance spine at its own
 * Supabase row (fetchFleetRecord/getFleetRecord already take a rowId).
