/**
 * Build-164 — lib/semantic-router.js
 *
 * SEMANTIC (meaning-based) domain scorer. SHADOW ONLY in B-164: it MEASURES which
 * domain a turn would map to by MEANING, never by keywords — but it changes NO
 * routing decision. The orchestrator logs what this WOULD pick (lane=sem:*)
 * alongside the real route so we can see how often meaning would fix a keyword
 * miss BEFORE letting it act (that flip is B-165). Same dormant-shadow contract
 * as Build-155's reg:* registry layer.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 *   The deterministic registry/arbiter (capability-registry.js + domain-arbiter.js)
 *   is still pattern-matching — novel phrasings ("tell me about my kafala operation")
 *   mis-route because no regex anticipated them. Embeddings map a turn to a point in
 *   meaning-space, so "tell me about my kafala operation" lands near the knowledge
 *   exemplars even though it shares no keyword with them. This is the real
 *   "understand what I mean" leap, and it is FREE: M8 already embeds for the
 *   knowledge graph (the same gemini-embedding-001 searchKnowledgeGraph uses).
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 *   - EXEMPLARS: a small curated map of domain -> a handful of example phrasings.
 *   - embedExemplars(): embed each exemplar ONCE (RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT) and cache the
 *     vectors in-module (warm-instance). Lazy + idempotent.
 *   - scoreSemantic(message): embed the message (RETRIEVAL_QUERY), cosine-compare to
 *     every exemplar, take each domain's best match, return the top domain + margin.
 *
 * PRIVACY: only the message TEXT is ever embedded — never any money figure (the
 *   wallet privacy wall is upstream; this module never sees DB rows or amounts).
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE: every public function swallows its own errors and returns null. A
 *   missing GEMINI key, a timeout, a malformed response — none can ever throw into
 *   the turn. With no key, embedText returns null ⇒ the cache is empty ⇒
 *   scoreSemantic returns null ⇒ the shadow logs nothing and the turn is untouched.
 *
 * THIS FILE CHANGES NO BEHAVIOUR ON ITS OWN. The orchestrator wires it in DORMANT
 * (shadow-log only) behind M8_SEMANTIC_ROUTER; nothing reads its result into a route.

// dataset (m8_router_misses, lane "arbiter:sem:%", 2026-06-29→30):
//   • the ONLY true fix — "tell me about my kafala operation" — scored conf 0.94 / margin 0.28;
