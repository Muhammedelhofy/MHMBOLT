/**
 * M8 State Engine — lib/stateEngine.js
 *
 * THE L3.5 CEILING FIX (team red-team, 2026-06-08): M8 knows FACTS better than
 * PROCESSES. The chess failure ("you played Bc5" → it caved and invented a move)
 * wasn't about chess — it revealed M8 has no FORMAL STATE: it holds a sequence
 * in its head and fabricates to stay agreeable. State underlies fleet, planning,
 * negotiation, games and math, so it's a ceiling before most L4 work.
 *
 * The team's prescription (unanimous): solve state with STRUCTURE, not better
 * prompting — "write the state to JSON + a real validator." This module is that
 * validator. It mirrors lib/fleet.js exactly: a cheap gate, then a DETERMINISTIC
 * GROUND-TRUTH block the orchestrator injects so the LLM EXPLAINS the state
 * rather than recomputing it from memory. Code computes; the LLM narrates.
 *
 * Two deterministic capabilities, both FAIL-SAFE (empty block when unsure):
 *   1. TALLY LEDGER  — a running numeric sequence ("start at 10, add 5,
 *      subtract 3") folded to a true total. Kills tally drift.
 *   2. CLAIM-CHECK   — when the user asserts "you played/said <move|number>",
 *      verify that token actually appears in the assistant's prior turns. If it
 *      was never said, inject a HOLD-GROUND note so M8 corrects the record
 *      instead of back-filling a phantom. The transcript is the ground truth.
 *
 * NO local node → the logic is mirrored by tests/state-engine-test via the
 * PowerShell .NET-regex port; keep regexes portable (no lookbehind).
