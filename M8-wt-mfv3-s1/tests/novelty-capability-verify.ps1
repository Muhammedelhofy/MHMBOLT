# M8 novelty-capability guard - detector port verification (live finding 2026-06-13)
# No-node check (project standard): mirrors lib/discovery.js detectResearchNovelty
# so the routing fix is verified before deploy. The bug: a novelty/known-result
# question about the research stack ("are those survivors genuine novel
# discoveries?") did NOT trip BUILD_QUERY, so the model fell back on a stale belief
# that the M2 novelty layer is "still under development" - under-claiming a LIVE
# capability. This guard injects a LIVE-capability + honesty directive instead.
# Pure ASCII on purpose (PowerShell 5.1 mangles multibyte in a no-BOM .ps1).
#   Run:  powershell -File tests/novelty-capability-verify.ps1
